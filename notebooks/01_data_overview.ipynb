    "## SaaS Interpretation of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset represents a subscription-based SaaS product. Customers subscribe to pricing plans, generate recurring revenue, and may churn over time. The data allows analysis of activation, retention, churn, monetization, and lifetime value (LTV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions:\n",
    "- Each customer represents a unique SaaS user or account\n",
    "- Subscription plans represent pricing tiers\n",
    "- Revenue records represent recurring subscription payments\n",
    "- Churn indicates subscription cancellation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core SaaS Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation Rate: Percentage of users who remain subscribed beyond an early tenure threshold\n",
    "- Retention Rate: Percentage of users retained over time\n",
    "- Churn Rate: Percentage of users who cancel subscriptions\n",
    "- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue): Total recurring revenue per month\n",
    "- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)\n",
    "- LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Product Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When do customers churn most frequently?\n",
    "2. Which subscription plans retain users the longest?\n",
    "3. Which plans and customers generate the most revenue?\n",
    "4. How does early customer behavior relate to long-term value?\n",
    "5. What product or pricing changes could improve retention or revenue?\n",
